Title: Sample size calculation under a sequential multiple assignment

Description: Sample size calculation to detect dynamic treatment regime (DTR) effects based on change in CAL outcomes from a non-surgical chronic periodontitis treatments study. The experiment is performed under a SMART design. The clustered tooth (sub-unit) level CAL outcomes are skewed, spatially-referenced, and non-randomly missing.
