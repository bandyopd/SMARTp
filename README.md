Title: "SMARTp: A SMART design for non-surgical treatments of chronic periodontitis with spatially-referenced and non-randomly 
missing skewed outcomes"

Authors: Jing Xu, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay, Sedigheh Mirzaei, Bryan Michalowicz, and Bibhas Chakraborty
  	        
Status:  "Under Review"


R codes for sample size calculation to detect dynamic treatment regime effect under a SMART design based on change in CAL outcomes measured in chronic periodontitis studies. The CAL outcomes exhibit non-Gaussian, spatial association, and non-randomly missing features.
